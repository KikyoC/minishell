=============
FORK
=============
Create a child process from the parent process
You should use it like this fork();

Returns:
 - -1 if there is an error
 - 0 if you are in the child process
 - the child pid if you are in the parent process

It make sense to check if it's 0 or -1 to handle child process and error and save the pid to wait it later

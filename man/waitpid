=============
WAITPID
=============
Wait for a child process to end
You should use it like waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int option)

If you don't care about options it does like wait but it will wait a definied child (pid_t parameter). Have the same behaviour than wait if you use it like wait(-1, &status)

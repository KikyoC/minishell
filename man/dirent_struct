There are 5 component which are : 
	-d_ino
	-d_off
	-d_reclen
	-d_type
	-d_name[256]

d_ino : inode number (node index)
	The ibnode value is a number gives every infos about a file,
	would it be it's size, it's authorisations
	An inode is a unique number until hard link are involved

d_off :
	octal number until the next file,
	commonly forgoten and not used
	often put to 0

d_reclen :
	readdir doesn't read that
	achive the size of a file, untile the next one

d_type :
	Give the type of the file if this doesn't work,
	then consider doing it with the lstat function.

d_name :
	give the name of the file (no way Sherlock) up to 256 characters
